**Project Description:**
The project aims to develop a real-time chat application using the Flutter framework for the frontend and Firebase as the backend service. This chat app will allow users to send and receive messages in real-time, create group chats, and interact with each other seamlessly.

**User Authentication:** Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication to allow users to register, log in, and log out securely.

**Real-time Messaging:** Utilize Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore to enable real-time messaging between users. Messages should be delivered instantly and synced across all devices in real-time.

**User Profiles:** Allow users to create and update their profiles with information such as name, profile picture, and status. This information should be visible to other users within the app.

**Group Chats:** Support group chats with multiple participants.
